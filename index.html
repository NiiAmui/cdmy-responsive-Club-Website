      <p>we are a friendly social team, lead by Joy and Dave Carter. We also like to dabble in the odd tournament. We take children's lessons over the weekend and our adult session is on a Wednesday night</p>
      <h2 class ="how">How can I join?</h2>
      <p>It's simple, just come along to the session that suits you and we'll take it from there. The first time you come its free so you can try before you buy.</p>
